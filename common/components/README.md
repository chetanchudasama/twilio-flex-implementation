# Common Components Library

The common components library contains UI elements and models that can be used across multiple Flex plugins.

It is written in react v16.13.1 and typescript v3.

## Contents

## Pre-requisites

See Pre-requisites section in the [main README.md file](../../README.md).

## Building the library

See Scripts section in the [main README.md file](../../README.md) for building and running the unit tests for this library.
When building the library, the components contained within will be compiled to CommonJS and ESM formats and a `lib` folder will be created containing the compiled files. The Flex plugins will then be able to reference any of the components in the library.
